##  Introduction

**TX0 Bot** is a professional-grade social engineering framework built for penetration testers, ethical hackers, and security researchers.  
It provides an advanced web-based control panel for gathering device information, geolocation, webcam access, and microphone access by leveraging phishing-based attack templates.

TX0 Bot was designed with flexibility in mind â€” allowing users to customize payload templates, control log data, and optionally forward collected information via Telegram bots or webhooks.  
The tool works seamlessly on localhost or your personal server/hosting, with optional tunnel management via Ngrok or any tunneling service of your choice.

This project is intended for **educational use, penetration testing in controlled environments, and security awareness demonstrations only**.

##  Features Overview

A detailed breakdown of the core features included in TX0 Bot:

- **Device Information Collection:**  
  Harvest detailed information from the victimâ€™s browser and device without needing explicit permissions.

- **Geolocation Tracking:**  
  Attempt to obtain precise geolocation from mobile devices (using browser-based APIs where possible).

- **Webcam Access:**  
  Capture images or video stream requests via the victimâ€™s webcam (with browser prompt).

- **Microphone Access:**  
  Similar to webcam functionality, access the microphone through crafted web templates.

- **Customizable Templates:**  
  Use and modify phishing pages tailored for different social engineering scenarios (chat apps, fake offers, services, etc.).

- **Telegram Integration:**  
  Send captured information and logs directly to a specified Telegram bot/channel.

- **Webhook Support:**  
  Forward events, logs, and captured data to your custom endpoint via HTTP POST requests.

- **Downloadable and Clearable Logs:**  
  Download stored logs or purge them directly from the control panel.

- **Runs on Localhost or Hosting:**  
  Deploy the framework on your local machine for testing or upload it to your personal hosting for real-world scenarios.

- **Ngrok (Deprecated):**  
  Auto Ngrok integration has been removed in the latest version â€” tunneling is now managed manually for better control.

##  Whatâ€™s New â€” Latest Update (July 8, 2025)

- Full codebase restructured for improved performance and modularity.
- Transitioned from a CLI tool to a web-based GUI with modern UI.
- Ngrok auto-start removed to avoid detection issues and restrictions â€” users manage their tunnels manually.
- Log management improved (download and clear logs directly from web panel).
- Telegram bot integration enhanced.
- Webhook event forwarding option added.
- Bugfixes from older releases fully addressed.
- Template system optimized for faster loading and easier customization.

## ðŸ”§ Environment Variables (for Auto Deployment)

You can configure key parameters via environment variables to automate setup:

- \`DEBUG_HTTP\` â€” Disable redirect
- \`PORT\` â€” Web server port
- \`TEMPLATE\` â€” Template index
- \`TITLE\` â€” Web page or group title
- \`REDIRECT\` â€” Redirect URL post execution
- \`IMAGE\` â€” Image for the web page
- \`DESC\` â€” Description for the template
- \`SITENAME\` â€” Name of the fake website
- \`DISPLAY_URL\` â€” URL displayed on template
- \`MEM_NUM\` â€” Group member count (if applicable)
- \`ONLINE_NUM\` â€” Online member count
- \`TELEGRAM\` â€” Telegram token and chat ID
- \`WEBHOOK\` â€” Webhook URL to receive POST requests

---

##  Default Access Credentials

Upon initial setup, access the web panel using:

| Username | Password |
|:------------|:------------|
| \`admin\`   | \`admin\`    |

Itâ€™s highly recommended to update these immediately after deployment.
